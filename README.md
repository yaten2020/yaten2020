# Hi, I'm Yatendra Kumar 👋  

🎓 **Molecular & Computational Biologist (PhD)** with 10+ years of postdoctoral experience in **functional genomics, epigenetics, and rare disease research**.  
💻 I bridge **biology and computation**: building reproducible pipelines, analyzing NGS data, and integrating multi-omics to uncover disease mechanisms.  
📍 Based in Edinburgh, UK.

## 🔬 Research & Expertise
- **Functional Genomics**: RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, MNase-seq  
- **Statistical Genetics**: GWAS, fine-mapping, variant prioritization, Mendelian randomisation  
- **Rare Disease Genomics**: linking regulatory variation with disease biology  
- **Computational Skills**:  
  - Python | R | Shell scripting  
  - Nextflow (workflow management), Docker/Conda (reproducibility)  
  - HPC clusters & cloud (AWS)  
- **Molecular Biology**: CRISPR/Cas9, prime editing, ZFPs, mammalian cell culture
